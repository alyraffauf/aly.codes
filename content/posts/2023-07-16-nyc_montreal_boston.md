My husband and I love to travel and, in 2023, we decided to take a trip backpacking through the Northeastern United States and Canada. We started by flying to New York City, and ended up in Boston by way of Montréal, upstate New York, and Vermont.

CW: rail foamer shots incoming.

## Atlanta -> New York City

## New York City -> Montréal

Originally, we planned to take the Amtrak Adirondack to Montreal, but, at the last minute, the train was canceled due to the summer heatwave. Fortunately, we were able to catch a Greyhound bus from Port Authority Bus Terminal, which took about 9 hours to get us to Gare d'autocars du Montréal. We had two wonderful days to explore the city full-time.

## Montréal -> Boston

After Montréal, we caught another 8-hour Greyhound bus from Gare d'autocars de Montréal to Boston South Station. In Boston, we stayed with friends, and honestly were pretty exhausted the whole time. Still, we rode some neat trains and ate some great food.

## Boston -> Atlanta

Ultimately, we flew back to Atlanta right on my birthday, over a week after flying out. I don't think I've ever been that relieved to see our cats again.
