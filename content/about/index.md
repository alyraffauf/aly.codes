    <h2>Hi, I'm Aly.</h2>
    <p>I'm a technology and GNU/Linux enthusiast based in Atlanta, Georgia. I got into tech in the mid-2000s—hosting websites on ThinkPads under my bed, installing SUSE Linux on anything that would boot, and rescuing old hardware from the trash. I've since worked as an academic researcher, data analyst, software developer, and sysadmin.</p>

These days, I'm all-in on immutable software infrastructure--both image-based operating systems with [bootc](https://bootc-dev.github.io/) and composable systems like [Nix](https://github.com/alyraffauf?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=nix&sort=) and [NixOS](https://nixos.org/). I use Nix to manage everything from hybrid cloud infrastructure at [cute.haus](https://cute.haus) to my Android phone with [nix-on-droid](github.com/nix-community/nix-on-droid). By day, I work in SEO, using automated data analytics and AI to make you click on things. By night, I'm either deep in my homelab, some obscure software project, or doing counter-intelligence for the [Xenofeminist](https://xenofeminism.org/manifesto/) slime horde.

I'm currently exploring new opportunities in cloud and DevOps and always enjoy connecting with like-minded tech and industry folks. Feel free to drop me an email or find me on socials. Let's chat!
