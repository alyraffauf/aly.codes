From 2017 to 2021, I was a graduate student in the [Department of Anthropology](https://anthropology.gsu.edu/) and the [School of Film, Media, and Theatre](https://fmt.gsu.edu/) at [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/). My research focused on the nexus of gender, technology, and visual culture.

Simultaneously, I worked as a research assistant providing support to faculty in data processing, visualization, and web scraping. I also worked as a teaching assistant and instructor for introductory anthropology and film courses.

I've compiled here a list of my publications and presentations, as well as courses I've taught. For a more exhaustive list, check out my [Curriculum Vitae](/files/cv.pdf).
